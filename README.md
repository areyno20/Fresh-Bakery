# Group7-Project1

## Project Description
For this project we decided as a team to make an app page for a bakery somewhere in Toronto.

Our imaginery bakery has four products which the customer can select; the system will then use the imformation that the customer provides to display the cost of the products, the total cost of teheir order, time till their order is ready and the distance between the store and their location.  

One of the requiremnts for the project was to make the page interactive; we achieved this in two ways:
1) By allowing the customer pick the quantity of the products the would like.
2) By asking the customer to put in their personal information in the order form section so that the system can do the calculation for the distance between locations.

Another project requirement was to use two API's at some point in our code. In order to achive this tasks we decided to use the Google Maps API and the Midíadía REST API. The google maps api was used to to carry out the calculations that tell the user how far they are from the store. The Midíadía REST API tells the customer about the ingredients used to make our products and their nutritional value.

In order to achieve the CSS styling you see on the app, we found a style sheet called Tailwind, we decided to go with it because it was similar to bootstrap in terms of how easy it is to use. It was very useful in polishing our UI so as to be attractive to potential customers.

We divided the tasks up by creating "issues" on GitHub so that we could keep track of what needed to be done and then who was in charge of doing what, this way two people would not be working on the same thing.

Once everything was done we deployed the finished website as seen below:
